## Comments
- services api request is POST (not GET) because it is not idempotent 
(It changes server state and after 5 retries returns another result). 
Also GET can be ca—Åhed during net transfer (and it skews user skill level).  
- 'undefined' status in response looks useful, it helps to separate the cases of refuse and tech failure
- if user not found services api returns http code 200 with 'undefined' multiplayer status 
- if user not found admin api returns http code 404
- 'timezone' field in status request looks useless but anyway required and validated
- delete method returns http code 200 (deleted) and 204 (nothing to delete) 
- the method "get all users" has a limit on the number of returned users (default 100)
